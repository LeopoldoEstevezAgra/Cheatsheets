# **My cheatsheets**

These are a few cheatsheets that contain some of my most used commands and keybindings
and I decided to store in one place for easy access.

A lot of them have modified keybindings so in some cases your set up could be quite
different than mine.

If you are interested I recommend checking out my [dotfiles](https://github.com/LeopoldoEstevezAgra/dotfiles)
repository for more detail on my personal remappings.
