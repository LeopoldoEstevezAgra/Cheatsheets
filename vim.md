# *Vim cheatsheet*

**Note** : It is taken for granted that all of this command are run as without 
the use of the vim command line entering the ':' key and represented as a code 
block `command` .

**Note** : In case that the command is a ':'  command is going to be indicated 
presented between square brackets     `[...]`

**Note** : All elements within `{...}` are always command variables or something 
that the user must type 

**Note** : This cheatsheet is not only going to contain basic vim comands , some
of them are going to be from plugins or my own modification and remapings so some
of them may not work in your specific situation , checking my 
[dotfiles](https://github.com/LeopoldoEstevezAgra/dotfiles) in any doubt
